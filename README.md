# spotify_problem

I wrote in efforts to helpout a friend with a take-home from Spotify. I also thought it would be a great way to practice some techniques and further buildout my took_kit i.e. cool tools.

Namely--
- threadpooling
- deadlining
- the word-break problem
- the coin-change problem
- memoizing
etc...

Now I'm trying solve the problem differently by applying the word-break algorithm.
